Is honey vegan?

Honey is decidedly non-vegan. Standard practice is to rip the wings off the queen so she can't escape, crush males alive to inseminate her with their corpses, and often take all their food and replace it with a sugar substitute (that isn't great for their health). They are often brought into non-native areas, where they compete with local bees causing die-offs (local bees are the ones we should be caring about, environmentally), where they can't survive the winter, and it's not uncommon for the beekeeper to find it more "financially sound" to just let the bees die off over the winter and get new ones in the spring. So they freeze and starve to death! Pretty nice, huh?

Even if a beekeeper is as "humane" as possible (just like your uncle's farm!), they're still systematically stealing food from bees. 12 bees entire lifetimes for a single teaspoon of honey. Building up their stores of honey is the only way for a hive to grow enough to expand and reproduce. They won't "swarm" until they have enough extra, and beekeepers intentionally keep them in a state of "you might starve if you don't keep working really hard!" so that they can never leave, and keep productive as possible.

There are no favors to bees being done here.
