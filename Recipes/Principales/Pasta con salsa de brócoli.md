##### Receta original

Pleasure! It's really super simple. For four portions, I boil two whole broccolis (I clean the stem, chop it up and use that too) for 10 minutes in plenty of boiling water. Plenty of water because I then add the pasta to that same pot while the broccoli is still in there. While the pasta and broccoli are cooking, I cut 3/4 garlic cloves in half and fry them in a pan with extra virgin olive oil with a chopped up dried chili pepper (quantity varies based on how spicy I want it to be). Fry garlic until golden brown. Turn off and cover if pasta isn't ready yet. 2/3 minutes before the pasta is ready, I use a skimmer to transfer it, as well as the broccoli, from the pot it's been cooking in into the sizzling hot pan with the garlic, extra virgin olive oil and chilli. Here's the secret to making it extra creamy. Add all of the pasta and broccoli, don't be afraid of adding water to the pan too. You have to cook the pasta for the remaining 2/3 minutes in the pan while adding the water you boiled it in (just a little bit at a time) and mixing it vigorously. I usually add like a large spoon of the boiling water, mix and stir until it has almost entirely evaporated and created a bit of creamy broccoli sauce, then repeat until it's all just creamy goodness. Also when mixing and stirring the pasta, broccoli and water in the hot pan, I like to hold the handle with both hands and sort of flip the ingredients so that the sauce which is at the bottom mixes well with everything. It's a very common way to make pasta really creamy in Italy. Try it out!

Edit: forgot to mention, this would be for 400 grams of pasta

Second edit: by 3/4 I mean 3 or 4 garlic cloves, not three fourths.
