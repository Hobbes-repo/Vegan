Creamy Almond and Coconut Butter

### Creamy Almond and Coconut Butter

##### Ingredientes
* 300 g almonds
* 80 g desiccated coconut
* 1 tbsp maple syrup optional
* 1 tsp coconut oil

##### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 175Â°C. Place almonds on a baking tray and place in oven for about ten minutes. Transfer almonds to food processor straight away. Spread the coconut on the same baking tray and place in the oven for about 2-3 minutes until just toasted. Transfer to food processor. 
2. Blitz the coconut and almonds for about 5 minutes until a slight paste forms, then add the coconut oil. 
3. Blitz again for about 10 minutes until the oils have been released and the mixture is runny. Add maple syrup at this point if you wish it to be a little sweeter. Blitz again for a further 2 minutes if you add the syrup.
