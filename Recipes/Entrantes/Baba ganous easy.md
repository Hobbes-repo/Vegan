Baba ganous easy

## Baba ganous easy

##### Ingredients
* 1 medium or 3/4 of a large eggplant
* 1 large clove garlic, grated or finely minced
* 1 lemon and a half, juiced
* 2 Tbsp Tahini
* sea salt
* optional: 2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, parsley or basil, chopped
* olive oil (for roasting)

##### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to high broil (or medium if you have the ability) and position a rack at the top of the oven.
2. Slice your eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and sprinkle with sea salt and place in a colander in the sink to drain any excess liquid. After 10 minutes, rinse slightly and then pat dry between two towels.
3. Arrange on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Roast for 5-10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the eggplant is softened and golden brown. Remove from pan, stack and wrap the rounds in foil to lock in moisture â€“ wait 5 minutes.
4. Peel away most of the skin of the eggplant (a little is OK) and add flesh to a food processor. It should be soft and tender and the skin should come off easy.
5. Add lemon juice, garlic, tahini, a pinch of salt and mix until creamy. Add herbs last and pulse to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more tahini and another pinch of salt.
6. Serve with pita and/or pita chips and veggies. Will keep covered in the fridge for several days.
